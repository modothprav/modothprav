# 📕 About me

I chose to be in the technology industry to contribute my share towards innovation and create meaningful work to progress mankind. From a very young age, logical problem solving has always appealed to me, which explains my interest in mathematics, programming and the sciences or STEM-related subjects as one would say. 

Knowing more about the world around me and solving various problems always created a spark of curiosity within me. This curiosity led me here to find out how technology that surrounds our day to day lives behaves and what can I do to improve upon creations made by our past generations. I enjoy the level of satisfaction obtained when finding a solution to a complex problem which motivates me to go look for another one and urges me to come back for more.
